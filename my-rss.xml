      <description>## Passage One

六级英语阅读模拟题The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated a shift in the world of work that had been simmering for years: the rise of remote and hybrid work models. Prior to 2020, many organizations viewed remote work as a occasional perk or a logistical necessity, rather than a sustainable long-term strategy. Today, however, a significant number of companies have embraced flexible work arrangements as a core component of their operations, reshaping not only how we work but also where and why we do it.

A 2024 survey conducted by the Global Workplace Analytics found that 68% of full-time employees now have the option to work remotely at least part of the time, a threefold increase from 2019. More notably, 45% of organizations reported that remote work has improved employee productivity, citing fewer office distractions and reduced commuting time as key factors. Conversely, 22% of respondents noted challenges related to communication gaps and maintaining team cohesion, highlighting the need for robust digital collaboration tools and clear management protocols.

The impact of this shift extends beyond individual productivity to broader economic and social trends. For instance, the demand for commercial real estate in major urban centers has declined by 18% since 2020, as companies downsize their physical offices or adopt hot-desking policies. This, in turn, has led to a "great relocation" of workers, with many choosing to move away from expensive cities to more affordable regions without sacrificing career opportunities. A case in point is Austin, Texas, which has seen a 30% increase in tech industry employees since 2021, largely driven by remote work flexibility.

However, the transition to flexible work is not without its pitfalls. A study by the American Psychological Association revealed that 57% of remote workers report feeling "always on call," blurring the boundaries between work and personal life. This has contributed to a rise in burnout rates, particularly among middle managers who struggle to balance oversight with employee autonomy. Additionally, there are concerns about unequal access to remote work opportunities, as low-wage and frontline workers—such as retail and healthcare employees—often lack the option to work from home, exacerbating existing workplace inequalities.

As we move forward, the future of work is likely to be defined by flexibility rather than uniformity. Organizations that succeed will be those that prioritize employee well-being, invest in inclusive digital infrastructure, and adopt hybrid models that leverage the benefits of both in-person and remote collaboration. For workers, this shift offers greater autonomy but also requires new skills—such as digital communication and self-management—to thrive in an increasingly flexible work environment.

### Answers and Explanations

1. **Answer: B**Explanation: The first paragraph clearly states that "Prior to 2020, many organizations viewed remote work as an occasional perk or a logistical necessity, rather than a sustainable long-term strategy." This directly matches option B. Options A and C contradict the text, while D is not mentioned as the general attitude before 2020.
    
2. **Answer: A**Explanation: The second paragraph mentions that "68% of full-time employees now have the option to work remotely at least part of the time, a threefold increase from 2019." This indicates that remote work has become a common option, which supports option A. Option B is incorrect because only 22% noted communication challenges, not "most companies." Option C is wrong as the number has increased, and D is false because remote work reduces commuting time.
    
3. **Answer: C**Explanation: In the third paragraph, it is stated that "many choosing to move away from expensive cities to more affordable regions without sacrificing career opportunities," which corresponds to option C. Option A is incorrect because demand for commercial real estate has declined, not prices increased. Option B is wrong as Austin saw a 30% increase in tech employees. Option D is false because remote work exacerbates inequalities.
    
4. **Answer: B**Explanation: The fourth paragraph mentions that "57% of remote workers report feeling 'always on call,' blurring the boundaries between work and personal life," which is the problem of balancing work and life. Thus, option B is correct. Options A, C, and D are not mentioned in the study by the American Psychological Association.
    
5. **Answer: B**Explanation: The last paragraph states that "Organizations that succeed will be those that prioritize employee well-being, invest in inclusive digital infrastructure, and adopt hybrid models." This directly supports option B. Option A is incorrect because the text advocates hybrid models, not fully remote. Option C contradicts the trend of flexible work. Option D is wrong as investing in digital tools is necessary.</description>
