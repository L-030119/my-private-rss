六级英语阅读理解模拟题（仔细阅读）
原文
In the age of digital transformation, remote work has evolved from a temporary workaround during the pandemic to a permanent fixture in many industries. A 2024 survey conducted by the Global Workplace Analytics found that 63% of companies now offer hybrid or fully remote work options, a 47% increase compared to 2019. This shift has not only redefined how we work but also sparked a profound debate about its long-term impact on productivity, employee well-being, and corporate culture.
Proponents of remote work highlight its undeniable benefits. For employees, it eliminates the daily commute, saving time and reducing stress associated with traffic jams and crowded public transportation. A study by Stanford University revealed that remote workers are 13% more productive than their office-based counterparts, attributing this to fewer distractions and more flexible work hours. For employers, remote work expands the talent pool beyond geographical boundaries, allowing them to hire the best candidates regardless of where they live. It also cuts down on overhead costs, such as office rent and utilities, which can translate into higher profits or increased investment in employee training.
However, critics argue that remote work comes with significant drawbacks. One of the most commonly cited issues is the blurring of boundaries between work and personal life. Without a physical separation between the office and home, many employees find themselves working longer hours, leading to burnout and decreased job satisfaction. Another concern is the erosion of corporate culture. In-person interactions, such as casual conversations by the coffee machine or team-building activities, are crucial for fostering collaboration and trust. When teams work remotely, these spontaneous exchanges are lost, which can hinder creativity and slow down decision-making processes.
Moreover, remote work exacerbates existing inequalities in the workplace. Employees who lack dedicated home offices or reliable internet connections struggle to perform at their best, putting them at a disadvantage compared to their more privileged colleagues. Additionally, younger employees and new hires may miss out on mentorship opportunities that are often passed down through face-to-face interactions, slowing their professional growth.
As remote work continues to shape the future of work, it is clear that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Companies must strike a balance between flexibility and structure, tailoring their policies to the needs of their employees and the nature of their business. For remote work to be successful in the long run, it requires intentional effort from both employers and employees—employers need to invest in technology and create inclusive policies, while employees must set clear boundaries and prioritize their mental health.

答案与解析
答案：B解析：根据原文第一段 “A 2024 survey conducted by the Global Workplace Analytics found that 63% of companies now offer hybrid or fully remote work options” 可知，63% 的公司（超过一半）现在提供混合或完全远程工作选项。A 选项是疫情期间的情况，并非调查结果；C 选项偷换概念，是提供远程工作选项的公司数量增长 47%，而非远程工作者数量；D 选项 “完全取代” 表述过于绝对。
答案：C解析：原文第二段明确提到 “remote workers are 13% more productive than their office-based counterparts, attributing this to fewer distractions and more flexible work hours”，即远程工作者效率更高的原因是干扰更少、工作时间更灵活。A 选项的培训和设备、D 选项的高薪和奖金在文中未提及；B 选项的节省通勤时间是远程工作的好处，但不是效率提升的直接原因。
答案：C解析：原文第三段指出批评者的观点，其中最常见的问题是 “the blurring of boundaries between work and personal life... leading to burnout and decreased job satisfaction”，即工作与生活界限模糊，导致员工倦怠。A 选项与原文相反，远程工作能降低公司运营成本；B 选项是远程工作的优势，而非缺点；D 选项文中说的是线下团建交流减少，而非线上。
答案：B解析：原文第四段提到 “Employees who lack dedicated home offices or reliable internet connections struggle to perform at their best, putting them at a disadvantage”，即没有合适居家办公条件的员工会处于劣势，这加剧了职场不平等。A 选项 “特权员工更易被解雇” 文中未提；C 选项 “年轻员工被迫加班更久” 无依据；D 选项是年轻员工和新员工的问题，只是不平等的表现之一，B 选项概括更全面。
答案：B解析：作者在文中既阐述了远程工作的优势（节省通勤时间、提升效率、扩大人才池等），也指出了其缺点（工作生活界限模糊、企业文化弱化、加剧不平等），最后提出需要平衡灵活性和结构性，没有偏向支持或反对的一方，态度是中立的。]]></description>
